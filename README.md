I'm **Ritobhash**, a student of economics with interests in development, finance, political science, and philosophy. This page is a humble attempt at distilling data and policy into digestable insights.

#### **What I Do**  
- **Skills:** Python, R, Julia, SQL, Stata, Tableau, Power BI, and the Microsoft Office Suite.  
- **Interests:** Data analysis, policy research, voting theories and the occasional philosophical ramble.  
- **Projects:** Iâ€™m currently working on exploring spatial voting models and quantifying electorates.  

#### **What Youâ€™ll Find Here**  
- **Data Projects:** Exploratory data analysis to visualisations. I use tools like Python, R, and Tableau to make sense of complex datasets.  
- **Policy Analysis:** I enjoy applying economic and political theory to real-world problems, especially in the context of development and welfare.  
- **Learning in Public:** Iâ€™m always experimenting with new tools and techniques, and I share my progress here.
